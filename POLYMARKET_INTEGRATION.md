## Order Signing (EIP-712)

Orders are signed using EIP-712 typed data signing:

```typescript
const domain = {
  name: 'Polymarket CTF Exchange',
  version: '1',
  chainId: 137, // Polygon
  verifyingContract: '0x4bFb41d5B3570DeFd03C39a9A4D8dE6Bd8B8982E',
};

const types = {
  Order: [
    { name: 'salt', type: 'uint256' },
    { name: 'maker', type: 'address' },
    { name: 'signer', type: 'address' },
    { name: 'taker', type: 'address' },
    { name: 'tokenId', type: 'uint256' },
    { name: 'makerAmount', type: 'uint256' },
    { name: 'takerAmount', type: 'uint256' },
    { name: 'expiration', type: 'uint256' },
    { name: 'nonce', type: 'uint256' },
    { name: 'feeRateBps', type: 'uint256' },
    { name: 'side', type: 'uint8' },
    { name: 'signatureType', type: 'uint8' },
  ],
};
```

## Security Considerations

- **No Private Keys Stored**: All signing happens in the user's wallet
- **Order Expiration**: Orders expire after 24 hours by default
- **Network Validation**: Automatically checks for Polygon network
- **Input Validation**: All inputs are validated before submission
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user feedback

## Performance Optimizations

- **Parallel API Calls**: Markets, trending, and profitable data fetched simultaneously
- **WebSocket Fallback**: Automatic polling if WebSocket connection fails
- **Debounced Updates**: Market data refreshed at optimal intervals
- **Lazy Loading**: Components render progressively with animations
- **Memoization**: React hooks prevent unnecessary re-renders

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Portfolio tracking and P&L calculation
- [ ] Advanced charting with TradingView integration
- [ ] Limit order management (view and cancel)
- [ ] Historical trade analysis
- [ ] Market alerts and notifications
- [ ] Social features (share trades)
- [ ] Mobile app version
- [ ] Multi-market comparison
- [ ] API key authentication for advanced features

## Troubleshooting

### Wallet Connection Issues
- Ensure MetaMask is installed and unlocked
- Check that you're on the Polygon network
- Clear browser cache and try again

### Order Placement Fails
- Verify you have sufficient USDC balance
- Check gas balance (MATIC) for transactions
- Ensure price is within 0-1 range
- Verify market is still accepting orders

### WebSocket Disconnections
- The client automatically reconnects with exponential backoff
- Fallback polling ensures data is still updated
- Check your internet connection

### API Rate Limiting
- Gamma API has rate limits on public endpoints
- WebSocket is preferred for real-time data
- Consider implementing caching for production

## Contributing

This is a production-ready implementation. When adding features:
1. Follow existing code patterns
2. Add comprehensive error handling
3. Update types in `lib/polymarket/types.ts`
4. Test with real wallet and orders
5. Update this documentation
