# Wager Integration Update

## ✅ Changes Completed

### 1. **Removed Standalone Wager Pages**
- ❌ Deleted `/app/wagers/crypto/page.tsx`
- ❌ Deleted `/app/wagers/sports/page.tsx`

### 2. **Updated Trade Page with Wager Integration**

**New Features:**

  - Sports: Search by team name
- ✅ Debounced search (500ms delay)
- ✅ Fetches wagers from Supabase with proper filtering

**Filter Logic:**
- **ALL**: Shows all wagers (no status filter)
- **OPEN**: `status === 'open'`
- **LIVE**: `status IN ['live', 'active', 'matched']`
- **SETTLED**: `status IN ['resolved', 'settled']`

### 3. **Updated WagerMarketCard Component**
- ✅ Removed navigation to non-existent pages
- ✅ Click handler now logs to console (placeholder for future detail page)

  - Animated iridescent borders
  - Faded grid pattern overlay
  - Mouse-tracking glow effects

### 4. **Updated Navbar**
- ✅ Removed Crypto and Sports links (pages no longer exist)
- ✅ Simplified to just show Trade link
- ✅ Cleaned up unused imports and state

## 🎯 User Experience

### Viewing Wagers
1. Navigate to `/trade` page
2. Click **₿ CRYPTO** or **🏆 SPORTS** tab
3. Use filter buttons to narrow down: ALL, OPEN, LIVE, or SETTLED
4. Use search bar to find specific wagers:
   - Crypto: Search "BTC", "ETH", etc.
   - Sports: Search team names
5. Click any wager card to view details (currently logs to console)

### Filtering System
- **Search**: Type-ahead search with 500ms debounce
- **Status Filters**: One-click filtering by wager state
- **Auto-refresh**: Filters re-fetch data automatically
- **Excluded**: Cancelled wagers are hidden by default
